The day unfolds in golden threads,
Whispering hopes across the air,
Footsteps wander gentle paths,
Seeking stories waiting there.
Shadows soften, hearts grow wide,
Moments bloom in subtle grace,
Time moves like a river’s hum,
Carving wonder into place.
Evening leans upon the hills,
Brushing skies with fading fire,
Stars prepare their quiet songs,
Calling dreams they will inspire.
Night wraps Earth in silver hues,
Calm enough to hold the past,
Yet wide enough for hopes to roam,
And weave a dawn that’s built to last.
